         </div>

        <div class="narrative">
            Sonic the Hedgehog is a game that was released on June 23, 1991. A blue hedgehog with supersonic speed must rescue animals from being turned into robots by a mad scientist who goes by the name of Dr. Robotnik. Throughout the game you play as the character known as Sonic as you go through a series of levels with opstacles saving captured animals. there are two ways of playing this game, more experienced players would prefer to speedrun the game and try to get a fast time, while non-experienced players would prefer to take it easy and enjoy the scenery. the story ends with Sonic and the multitude of freed woodland animals celebrating in Green Hill Zone, thus sonic being hailed as hero.

        <div class="Gamemechanics">
           Sonic games over the years, from being in 2D to 3D. While the games have been changing, his controls have also been changing as well. back in the late 1900's Sonic games on the Sega Genesis were very straight forward. the A button would allow sonic and the joy stick would allow sonic to move around, since its in 2D Sonic is only allowed to move in to directions. as Sonic games enter the early 2000's, Sonic has switched from 2D to 3D, Which means there will be alot more controls to learn. for example in Sonic unleashed you take control of sonic in two different ways his normal form and his werehog. in his normal form you have the A button to jump and attack and the B button to slide also newly added the right trigger "RT" to speed boost.

        <div class= "Character">
            Sonic is very well known for his supersonic speed. Sonic made is first appearence on the Sega Genesis with is very own game "Sonic the Hedgehog". Although sonic games may be very simple Sega decide to work with there biggest rival console known as Nintendo and put sonic in a fighting game call Super Smash Bros which is a fighting with characters from different nintendo games. this game gave sonic so much potencial because Sonic now gets a speciffic moveset that allows him to attack normally with punches and kicks including his moveset from his older games. Sega continued to work with Nintendo and put sonic in future games (mostly Mario games).

        <div class="Audio">
            There are many kinds of sounds within Sonic games, some being diegetic and some non-diegetic sounds. An example would be if sonic were to collect a ring it makes a ringing sound, that would be diegetic becuase it can be heard by characters within the game. another example would be if Sonic were to jump on a spring it would make a boing sound which can also be heard by the character in game. as there are many diegetic sounds in Sonic there are also non-diegetic sounds as well. For example if sonic was running really fast and "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen started playing that would be non-diegetic. in sonic games there are soundtracks that can me heard by the player not by the game character.
